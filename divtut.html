    <h2>Div tutorial</h2>
    <b>Divs</b><p>is a way to make boxes with info it in. We can also use CSS to color it, animate it, transform it(scale, rotate etc) but we can start of in the CSS where we type this <br>"div {<br>background-color: lime;<br>width: 200px;<br>height: 100px;<br>border: 2px solid black;<br>}"<br>What this does it that it sets the color to lime, sets the width to 200px, the height to 100px and the border to 2px solid black. Here's how it looks</p>
    <div></div>
    <p>We can also add text in bewteen the two &ltdiv&gtHere&lt/div&gt but you can use the h2 to make a title to it and a &ltp&gt to make some text which should look like this.</p>
    <div>
        <h2>Here's my h2</h2>
        <p>Here is the p</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Feel free to customize it how ever you'd like.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Next is Transforming it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In our css we will make it look like this
        <br>"div {<br>background-color: lime;<br>width: 200px;<br>height: 100px;<br>border: 2px solid black;<br>transition-duration: 0.5s;<br>transform: all;<br>}"<br>This will rotate the div 20 degrees and scale it to 1.5 times its size. Now go some lines down (outside the div {}) now make a "div:hover". We should make it look like this.<br>div:hover {<br>transform: rotate(20deg) scale(1.5);<br>}
        <br>Which whould make it look like this when you hover over it (try hovering over the box) it is important that "transform: rotate(20deg) scale(1.5);" (the rotate and scale) are next to each other. It doesn't matter in which order.
    </p>
        <div class="adiv"></div>
        <br>
        <p>Feel free to customize.<br>
        If you want to. </p>
